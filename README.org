* 17 NoSQL: Social Network API
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nosql-social-network-api
:END:
** Your Task
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: your-task
:END:
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed
with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over
the last part of this course, you'll use several of the technologies
that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications.
Because the foundation of these applications is data, it's important
that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

Your Challenge is to build an API from scratch for a social network web
application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends'
thoughts, and create a friend list. You'll use Express.js for routing, a
MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the
[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/express][Express.js]] and
[[https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose][Mongoose]] packages, you may
also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the
native JavaScript =Date= object to format timestamps.

No seed data is provided, so you'll need to create your own data using
Insomnia after you've created your API.

Because this application won't be deployed, you'll also need to create a
walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the
following acceptance criteria being met. You'll need to submit a link to
the video and add it to the README of your project.

Refer to the
[[https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide][Video
Submission Guide]] on the Full-Stack Blog for additional guidance on
creating a video.

** User Story

#+begin_src md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
#+end_src

** Acceptance Criteria
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: acceptance-criteria
:END:
#+begin_src md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
#+end_src

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes
being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all
thoughts being tested in Insomnia:

The following animation shows GET routes to return a single user and a
single thought being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST, PUT,
and DELETE routes for thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows the POST and DELETE routes for a user's
friend list being tested in Insomnia:

In addition to this, your walkthrough video should show the POST and
DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

** Getting Started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
:END:
Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the
[[https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb][MongoDB
installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog]] to install MongoDB locally.

Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

*** Models
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: models
:END:
*User*:

- =username=
  - String
  - Unique
  - Required
  - Trimmed
- =email=
  - String
  - Required
  - Unique
  - Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching
    validation)
- =thoughts=
  - Array of =_id= values referencing the =Thought= model
- =friends=
  - Array of =_id= values referencing the =User= model (self-reference)

*Schema Settings*:

Create a virtual called =friendCount= that retrieves the length of the
user's =friends= array field on query.

--------------

*Thought*:

- =thoughtText=
  - String
  - Required
  - Must be between 1 and 280 characters
- =createdAt=
  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query
- =username= (The user that created this thought)
  - String
  - Required
- =reactions= (These are like replies)
  - Array of nested documents created with the =reactionSchema=

*Schema Settings*:

Create a virtual called =reactionCount= that retrieves the length of the
thought's =reactions= array field on query.

--------------

*Reaction* (SCHEMA ONLY)

- =reactionId=
  - Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  - Default value is set to a new ObjectId
- =reactionBody=
  - String
  - Required
  - 280 character maximum
- =username=
  - String
  - Required
- =createdAt=
  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

*Schema Settings*:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the =reaction=
field's subdocument schema in the =Thought= model.

*** API Routes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: api-routes
:END:
*=/api/users=*

- =GET= all users

- =GET= a single user by its =_id= and populated thought and friend data

  #+begin_src json
  {
    "username": "lernantino",
    "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
  }
  #+end_src

- =PUT= to update a user by its =_id=

- =DELETE= to remove user by its =_id=

*BONUS*: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

--------------

*=/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId=*

- =POST= to add a new friend to a user's friend list

- =DELETE= to remove a friend from a user's friend list

--------------

*=/api/thoughts=*

- =GET= to get all thoughts

- =GET= to get a single thought by its =_id=

- =POST= to create a new thought. Don't forget to push the created
  thought's =_id= to the associated user's =thoughts= array field. (note
  that the examples below are just sample data):

  #+begin_src json
  // example data
  {
    "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
    "username": "lernantino",
    "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
  }
  #+end_src

- =PUT= to update a thought by its =_id=

- =DELETE= to remove a thought by its =_id=

--------------

*=/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions=*

  array field

- =DELETE= to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's =reactionId=
  value
